what is the size of the data?
what high availabiliity is needed?
network requirement?
read heavey or write heavy?
is there any single point failure? for example load-balancer( we can have two load balancer, and send heartbeat to each other, if one fails, another can take all the request)

load balancer, where to put:
example 
                   client
                 LB --LB
            web server     WS    WS     WS
             distributed cache  ( his or miss?)
                 LB---LB
            DB-master1       DB-master2    DB-master3
    DB-replica1.1,1.2       DB-replica2.1,2.2    DB-replica3.1,3.2
