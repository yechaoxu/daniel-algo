function requirement:
    upload/download file
    sync file betweeen platform within same user
    history of version support of file
    share file between users
    storage limit per user
    file size, no limit, only total storage size limit

non-function requirement:
    how to handle one file with many revision ?
    ACID , ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) 
    fault tolerant
    low bandwidth
    performance
    
    
how sharing file will work?
    sharing file is happening in metadata database. 
    user table:
    file_id , owner_id. read_only_user_id, rw_user_id 
    
    file table:
    file_id, file_name, owner_id
    
how to scale:
sharding with replica, 
#1 shard by user_id, issue is the user can have access to many other user's file and it will need to read all other shards to get the info. 



using consistent hashing, hash_func(user_id+file_id)
    
    
    
    
               Client
               
          Dropbox Server,  metadata service,            
            S3 storage  /   DB for metadata.
