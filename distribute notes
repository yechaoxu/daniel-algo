Load balancer:
             DNS, can use rounding robbin, hash the ip. 


cache:
      how to manage cache is called cache policy ( LRU)
      cache miss
      cache size matter. if it is too small it will hurt performance. 
      cache consistency:
                        write through , means write operation go through cache before , before goes to database 
                        write back.      means write operation to database first, then write back


Database Index:
        In database management systems, a reverse key index strategy reverses the key value before entering it in the index.1 E.g., 
        the value 24538 becomes 83542 in the index. Reversing the key value is particularly useful for indexing data such as sequence numbers,
        where each new key value is greater than the prior value, i.e., values monotonically increase.
        Reverse key indexes have become particularly important in high volume transaction processing systems because they reduce contention for index blocks
