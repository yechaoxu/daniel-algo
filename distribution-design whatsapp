wahts app design

requirement:
	point to point
	group message
	image sharing
	send deliverted/ read recepits
	
	
	
	client app                  client app
		\                            /
		      gateway /gateway/gateway
					||
	(micro service)	message routing service/ mes /mes / mes
					
					||
					
			session service(stores which user is registered) /grouping service( manage which member is in the group)
					||
				back -end database,  stores ( last log in time, message that not delivered )
				session service can has its own database
				group service can has its own database
	
	
	how would micro service know how to find the receipt client?
	
	each client will need to regsiter to a mes.  

	
	
	
	details:
		gateways, heavy on memory, it uses websocket, need to push as many functions to the back-end as possible. 
		groupid -- use id : database
		consistent hash-- determines which user is in which server
		each time a user connect to the service, a thread is createdt , and database is logged the activity with pid as key
		media sharing: it will be a different connection compare to websocket, sender upload to a media storage via http, get a hash value, the value is sent to receiver, and receiver download the media from media storage via that hash value. 
	as many functions to the back-end as possible. 
		groupid -- use id : database
		consistent hash-- determines which user is in which server
