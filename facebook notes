system-design-my-approach:

1) clarify requirement. 
2) functional requirement
3) non-functional requirement  , (read heavy / write heavy) (horizontal scale) ( 80/20 rule, cache)
4) exposure API for data in/out
4) high level module. 
5) star to scale, what trade off. 
6) dive deep.

3 common topic:
	1) communication, via TCP or UDP, or RPC which is based on TCP/IP
	
	2) storage, sql vs no-sql
