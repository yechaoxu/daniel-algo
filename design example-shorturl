short url design:
	logic design first:
			web API-> what web interface will look like. 
			http -redirect -> short url to long url. 
			
	back-end:
		storage:
			because it is high through put. no relation need. just long-short. 
			so it will use nosql database. key/value pair. 
			because we allows one long url to multiple short url. 
			key/value pair = shorturl: longurl
	
	
	6000 * 10 kb/s = 10MB/s
	10MB *3600 * 24 = mb per day.  * 365 = one year storage.
