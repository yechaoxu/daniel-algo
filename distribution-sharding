Sharding is horizontal partitioning.
Sharding uses shared-nothing architecture.  it does not share any common data or computing resource. 
Auto-sharding, Mysql Cluster, MongoDB. 
key based sharding
  Key is generated via hash function, which will determins which shard to go. 
  evenly distribute data.
  but when you dynamically add or remove shards the hash value would be re-generated for most of values
range based sharding
  shard based on the value of the data, such as tag_id. its easy to implement, but can not ensure a evenly distributed sharding, but is easier when add/remove node.
