basic strucuture
        
    Region(Master)                                       Region(slave)         Region(slave)
      /\                                                    /\

      memcache                                           memcache

     Storage Cluster(master)   (storage replication)->      storage cluster(slave)       
     
     
     
   In each cluster
   a single web request results in hundreads of get request
   thus data is distributed inside cluster via consistent hashing
   thus every webserver talks to many memcache server, it is a all to all network. data replication is used to reduce the each memcache load
   TCP for set/delete .( high reliability)
   UDP for get ( high availbility)
   within each pool, we could either distribute the keys( consistent hashing), or replicate between memcache server. 
   --- some case say a webrequest have 100 keys per request, if we distriubte keys to different server, web request /sec is almost the same for each server. 
                       but if we replicate the memcache server, we reduce the web reqeust to 50% if we doulbe the memcache server. 
                       web request cost vs key request cost 
   how to handle failure: spare memcache server that idle during normal, and if any server is dead the idle pool will receive the request. 
   
   
   in Region:
   regional invalidation- a special service running and checks the operation to back-bone database and detecs any update/del . and broadcast to memcache in that region.
   invalidate via web server's boradcast is not idealy, 1) more traffic in the front end. 2) no recourse when system is misconfigured. 
   each cluster independenly cache data based on user request.  if user requests are randomly send to each cluster in the region we exepct the cached data to be evenly distributed. 
   one master copy , and all other region is read only replica. 
   --write from other replica regison, 1) set a special marker in that region, 2) perform write to master 3) delete key in memcache
                                        during write time, the marker indicates all get request to get data from database.
