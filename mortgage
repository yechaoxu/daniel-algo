The loan interest is calculated on a daily basis. This means that we          
will collect interest until the day we receive the payoff funds.              
                                                                              
We may continue to make the real estate tax and property insurance            
premium payments from the escrow account. Any amount held in escrow at        
closing will be settled in accordance with the applicable federal law.

Timing of loan payoff:                                                        
Total amount outstanding is good through 10-30-20, or until any activity      
occurs on the account. Funds received after that date will be subject to      
an additional $ 71.07 of interest per Day. Issuance of this                   
statement does not suspend the contractual requirement to make payments       
when due. If payments are not made, we may assess a late charge of            
$ 169.96 to the loan.                                                         
                                                                              
We may adjust figures in this statement, if prior to the payoff date:         
* We make additional mortgage insurance premium payments.                     
* We make disbursements from the escrow account for items due.                
* Any check/electronic withdrawal previously credited to the loan             
  is rejected by the financial institution from which it is drawn.
